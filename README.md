# Risk
**Introduction** <br />
Final project in the Object Oriented Programming and Network Programming subjects. I was trying to make something, which will take me from the very beggining to a new level of C++. Final effect is a bundle of ideas, me testing out different approaches, starting from very simple, to quite complex structures, what ended up working but a mess. Now, I'd build it differently (these classes are just bad), but I treat it more like a battleground for my ideas, sorry for that. I plan to rework main program a bit, so it will be more readable and clear. **Currently, game has singleplayer (0.1) and multiplayer (0.2) versions separately, I want to merge them together in v0.3.**

**Game Structure** <br />
The game is separated to 2 phases (gonna rework it, read CHANGELOG v0.4 to learn more): Initialization Phase and Main Phase. 

**Initialization Phase** <br />
In initialization Phase, players place troops on the map.
