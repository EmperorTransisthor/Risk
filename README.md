# Risk
**Introduction**
Final project in the Object Oriented Programming and Network Programming subjects. I was trying to make something, which will take me from the very beggining to a new level of C++. Final effect is a bundle of ideas, me testing out different approaches, starting from very simple, to quite complex structures, what ended up working but a mess. Now, I'd build it differently (these classes are just bad), but I treat it more like a battleground for my ideas, sorry for that. I plan to rework main program a bit, so it will be more readable and clear.
